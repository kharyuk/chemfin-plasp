ex1.1 - ex1.6: platfrom = LCMS-IT-TOF
ex2.1: platfrom = LCMS-IT-TOF
ex2.2 - 9 samples in 3 extraction methods (27 samples), platfrom = LCMS-IT-TOF 
ex2.3 - 9 samples in 3 extraction methods (27 samples), platfrom = Agilent QqQ 


ex2.2,ex2.3,ex2.4 are used in article4 to test how algorithm works on samples
which were extracted in different way and/or made on different LC-MS platform.
